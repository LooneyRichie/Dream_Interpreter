# Dream_Interpreter
I have an idea to implement many different psychological and mystical features in one convenient app designed to help people cope with stress. I plan to use Astrology, Numerology, Tarot, Rorschach, Psychology, Dream Analysis, Myer Briggs Personalities...more to come soon. I am welcome to critique, I can't excel without it. Feel free to help, if this ever becomes anything worth anything and you helped me I will honor your work. A few of the programs were stand alone programs I intend to merge into one. The idea is to use python with javascript or any other language, I am proficient in more than ten coding languages so whatever language you have in mind, I am open.
